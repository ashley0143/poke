## Hosting Poke~
### With NodeJS
- To self host your own Poke instance, you'll need the following:

  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - [npm](http://npmjs.com) (Included with Node.js)

Once you have everything, clone our repo:

```
git clone https://codeberg.org/ashley/poke.git
```

You can also clone using our Github mirror if you'd prefer:

```
git clone https://github.com/ashley0143/poke.git
```

Or you can use our forgejo instance:

```
git clone https://git.poketube.fun/ashley/poke.gitt
```

Now, install the needed dependencies within the Poke folder:
( go to the folder by running cd pokee)
```
npm install 
```

Once everythings installed, start your server with the following command:

```
node server.js
```

Congrats, Poketube should now be running on `localhost:6003`!

### With Docker
Create a new directory for PokeTube:
```
mkdir poketube && cd poketube
```

Download the docker compose and config file:
```
curl -O https://codeberg.org/Ashley/poketube/raw/branch/main/docker-compose.yml
```

Run PokeTube:
```
docker compose up -d
```

PokeTube should be running on `http://localhost:6003`.

The port can be changed with the config file you downloaded, just change the `server_port` option.
