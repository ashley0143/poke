      <summary>DMCA Policy</summary>
      <p class="date">Last updated: October 17, 2025</p>
      <p>
        Poke operates as a <strong>privacy-friendly frontend for YouTube</strong> and does not host or store video content.  
        All material viewed through Poke originates directly from YouTube’s servers.  
        As such, copyright claims concerning specific videos or media should be directed to YouTube, not Poke.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you believe that Poke has improperly displayed or proxied material in a way that violates your copyright,  
        please first confirm whether the material appears directly on YouTube.  
        If it does, the proper channel for resolution is YouTube’s <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622" target="_blank">DMCA takedown form</a>.  
        YouTube has the authority and mechanisms to process copyright claims under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
      </p>
      <p>
        Poke does not modify, rehost, or alter YouTube content in any way.  
        Our systems act purely as a <strong>transient intermediary</strong> under 17 U.S.C. § 512(a), transmitting publicly accessible data.  
        Therefore, any DMCA claim directed at Poke itself would not be valid, as we do not control or store the material.
      </p>
      <p>
        In rare cases where Poke’s systems display mislinked or erroneously proxied material not present on YouTube,  
        you may contact us via our issue tracker at  
        <a href="https://codeberg.org/ashley/poke/issues" target="_blank">https://codeberg.org/ashley/poke/issues</a>  
        and provide:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your name and contact information</li>
        <li>A link to the infringing content as displayed on Poke</li>
        <li>A link to the corresponding YouTube video (if applicable)</li>
        <li>A brief description of your claim and the nature of the alleged infringement</li>
      </ul>
      <details>
        <summary>Privacy of Submitted DMCA Information</summary>
         <p>
          Any personal information you submit in a DMCA-related report (such as your name, contact details, or legal documentation)  
          will be used <strong>solely</strong> for the purpose of evaluating and responding to your claim.  
          This data will not be shared publicly, sold, or reused for any other purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Poke does not maintain permanent user accounts or personal databases,  
          and any DMCA submission data is handled manually, reviewed, and deleted after the issue has been resolved.  
          We strongly recommend that you avoid submitting unnecessary personal details.
        </p>
        <p>
          Submissions through our Codeberg issue tracker are governed by Codeberg’s own privacy policy.  
          Please ensure that any sensitive or identifying information is shared privately and only when essential  
          for resolving the reported issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          By submitting a DMCA-related request, you consent to the temporary processing of your contact data  
          for communication regarding your claim, after which it will be securely discarded.
        </p>
      </details>
      <p>
        Once received, we will review and, if applicable, adjust how the data is proxied to ensure accuracy and compliance.  
        However, as Poke does not host or control the content, permanent takedown requests must be directed to YouTube itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Poke respects the rights of content creators and copyright holders,  
        and we comply with all applicable provisions of the DMCA and EU Directive 2001/29/EC.  
        Our mission remains focused on providing a privacy-conscious viewing experience, not redistributing copyrighted works.

      <summary>Content Source & Legal Basis</summary>
      <p class="date">Last updated: October 17, 2025</p>
      <p>
        Poke functions as a <strong>privacy-friendly frontend for YouTube</strong>, providing an alternative interface  
        to publicly available YouTube content. It allows users to watch videos, view metadata, and explore channels  
        without being tracked, profiled, or exposed to intrusive advertisements.
      </p>
      <p>
        All videos, thumbnails, and metadata are retrieved from YouTube’s public endpoints using  
        reverse-engineered, community-understood protocols such as <strong>youtubei</strong> (used internally by YouTube’s own clients).  
        We <strong>do not</strong> use the official <strong>YouTube Data API v3</strong>, nor have we ever agreed  
        to Google’s API Terms of Service. Therefore, we are not contractually bound by those terms.  
        A similar case involving the Invidious project was raised by YouTube’s legal team in 2023  
        (<a href="https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/issues/3872" target="_blank">GitHub Issue #3872</a>),  
        and no legal action was taken, as such usage is within lawful grounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under <strong>United States law (17 U.S.C. § 512(a))</strong>, part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA),  
        intermediaries that “transmit material through a system or network without modification of its content” are lawful.  
        Poke qualifies under this protection because it only passes data between YouTube and the user without altering content.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the <strong>European Union</strong>, the project is protected under Directive <strong>2001/29/EC</strong>  
        of the European Parliament, which permits “temporary acts of reproduction that are transient or incidental  
        and an integral part of a technological process” enabling network transmission.  
        Poke’s operation — fetching, parsing, and displaying transient data — fully complies with this legal definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Poke is not illegal</strong>. It does not redistribute or rehost copyrighted material,  
        nor does it bypass technological protection measures. It simply acts as a neutral layer  
        for viewing publicly available YouTube data in a privacy-focused way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Poke <strong>does not endorse, agree with, or moderate</strong> the videos, channels, or comments it displays.  
        All such content originates directly from YouTube and remains under the control of its creators and YouTube itself.  
        The Poke Project cannot verify, censor, or selectively remove content, as it merely provides a client-side proxy  
        to what YouTube already serves publicly. Opinions expressed in YouTube videos do not represent the views  
        of the Poke Project, its maintainers, or contributors.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you encounter unlawful or infringing content, please report it directly to YouTube via their official tools.  
        If you believe Poke is displaying something incorrectly, you may reach out to us at our issue tracker:

      <summary>AI Training Policy</summary>
      <p class="date">Last updated: October 17, 2025</p>
      <p>
        The Poke Project <strong>strictly prohibits</strong> the use of its content, data, or media streams  
        for training, fine-tuning, or feeding any form of artificial intelligence or machine learning models.  
        This includes, but is not limited to, video content, metadata, comments, thumbnails, transcripts,  
        and other data accessed through the Poke interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        The materials displayed through Poke are subject to copyright owned by their respective creators  
        and may not be reproduced or processed for automated learning systems.  
        Using YouTube data or Poke’s interface for AI dataset creation would constitute unauthorized reuse  
        of copyrighted works and therefore violates this policy.
        Any organization or individual found scraping, aggregating, or storing Poke content for AI training  
        purposes will be considered in direct violation of this policy and may face reporting or blocking  
        from our network services.

      <summary>Coding Policy</summary>
      <p class="date">Last updated: October 17, 2025</p>
      <p>
        Contributors to the Poke Project are welcome to use <strong>AI-assisted coding tools</strong>  
        such as code autocompletion, linters, or assistants — provided that they understand and verify  
        the code being submitted. Automated or unverified contributions that contain insecure, unclear,  
        or copied proprietary code are <strong>not acceptable</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI-assisted coding is allowed, but all contributors are responsible for ensuring their changes  
        meet the project’s quality, security, and licensing requirements.  
        The Poke maintainers cannot guarantee that AI-generated code will always be correct, safe,  
        or efficient — contributors are expected to review and test thoroughly.
      
       AI-assisted coding is <strong>OK</strong> — but use it wisely, understand your code,  
        and never rely on it blindly.
      </p>

      <summary>Coding Style Policy</summary>
      <p class="date">Last updated: October 17, 2025</p>
      <p>
        The Poke Project values clean, readable, and consistent code across all modules and languages.  
        Contributors are encouraged to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use <strong>two spaces</strong> for indentation (no tabs).</li>
        <li>Keep lines under 100 characters when possible.</li>
        <li>Write <strong>clear variable names</strong> — no cryptic one-letter identifiers.</li>
        <li>Follow the existing structure and naming conventions of the project.</li>
        <li>Use comments sparingly but meaningfully — explain <em>why</em> something happens, not what it does.</li>
        <li>Keep code GPL-compliant and avoid importing non-free dependencies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Code consistency helps keep Poke maintainable, accessible, and true to its free software ideals.  
        Before submitting a pull request, contributors are encouraged to test their changes  
        and make sure they integrate smoothly with the existing codebase.

      <p>
        Poke is developed and maintained with love and care, but it is still provided entirely “as is.”  
        We do not guarantee perfect performance, uninterrupted uptime, or freedom from bugs and technical glitches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Poke is primarily developed and tested on <strong>Firefox</strong> and other standards-compliant browsers.  
        While it should function on most modern browsers, full compatibility on Chromium-based or alternative browsers  
        cannot be guaranteed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Poke team cannot promise that every feature will always function as expected or remain available in the future.  
        Servers may experience downtime, network issues, or maintenance breaks without notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we do our best to maintain stable service, no warranty is provided for uptime, speed, or data integrity.  
        Your usage of Poke implies acceptance that unexpected behavior or interruptions may occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project maintainers, contributors, and distributors are not liable for any damages, losses, or inconvenience  
        caused directly or indirectly by using Poke, its APIs, or related software.

      <p>
        Poke does not offer any commercial guarantees, technical support, or service-level agreements.  
        It is a volunteer-driven, community-based project made freely available for everyone.

      <p class="date">Last updated: October 17, 2025</p>
      <p>
        Poke includes an internal filter system that identifies commonly known disinformation and conspiracy sources  
        such as InfoWars, Breitbart, Daily Mail, RT, and others.  
        This system serves only as a <strong>warning mechanism</strong> to encourage users to verify what they read.  
        You are free to access or view such content — the warning does not restrict access, censor, or block anything.  
        It merely provides informational context based on publicly available fact-checking records.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users are encouraged to cross-reference claims, verify sources through reliable outlets,  
        and remain mindful of misinformation when browsing external links or content.  
        The Poke Project does not control, filter, or prevent access to these domains;  
        the warnings are purely educational in nature.
