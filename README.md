 <h1> PokeTube Source Code </h1> 
  This is the source code of PokeTube! The youtube front-end that doesn't track you ^^ <br> <br> For matomo's source code, see <a href="https://github.com/poketube-org/poketube/tree/main/t"> here. </a>
  <br> <br> 
  See https://poketube.fun/domains for the instances of PokeTube :^ <br> <br>

   To self host, you'll need  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. When you do,simply download the repo and run `node server.js` or `npm start` in the terminal. Btw, you probably need a lot of ram to host this :P (I recommend around 8 GB free)
